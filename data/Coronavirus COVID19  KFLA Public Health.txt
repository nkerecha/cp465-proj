Hi my name is Dr. Kieran Moore I'm the medical officer of Health for KFL&A Public Health. My first words are words of gratitude. I have to thank everyone in our community for pitching in, for doing their part, for obeying the rules, for being so reasonable at a very difficult time. Through our combined efforts we've been able to minimize the impact of COVID-19 on our community. It's made a difference and as a result we are now in a new phase in our response to COVID-19. We're going to see the economy opening up. We must remain vigilant. We must remain reasonable and prudent, as you have all done in the first wave, and ensure that this virus doesn't have any significant effects on the health of our community. Most at risk for COVID-19 are those that have any other chronic illness, and or, those that are over 70. In particular, those in long-term care facilities or retirement homes. So, we must continue to protect those individuals, and for retirement homes and long-term care facilities, in particular, we can't let our guard down. So, what we've done for the first wave, we'll have to do for the second, third, or any subsequent wave of this infection in our community. We'll have to pitch in do our part, knowing that we're all in this together, everyone has a part to play to prevent the spread of COVID-19 in our community. All of this will lead us to be living in a new normal, where we must continue to wash our hands, we must continue to have social and physical distancing, and minimize the next wave or any subsequent waves of COVID-19 in our community. We do still want everyone to stay home as much as possible, to stay local. So, still try to hunker down, and stay within our region, and also support our local economy, and local businesses. Staying safe, staying local, and supporting local businesses are the best things to do for our region in the coming months.
