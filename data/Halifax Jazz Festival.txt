To kick off the summer, we’ve collaborated with the National Arts Centre to present #CanadaPerforms #RoadToCanadaDay. We’ll be streaming live from Sonic Temple with two very special performances directly to Halifax Jazz Festival’s Facebook page on June 22nd & 26th at 7pm.

After the announcement that HJF 2020 would not proceed as planned this year, our team set out to create an online festival experience that would unite and inspire music lovers at home this summer. We are excited to present a program that highlights and celebrates the amazing community, people, talent, and spirit of the East Coast.

Throughout July, tune in on Facebook every Tuesday at 11am for Canadian Jazz Interviews with hosts Andrew Jackson and Charles Hsuen. An integral part of HJF has always been education. We'll be offering four Jazz Labs this July on Thursday mornings at 11am, live on Zoom and Facebook.

Our Creative Music Workshop usually runs at the same time as the main festival, but this year it’s going to shift its date and while we’re still working out the details, we’ll share more information about it soon, please stay tuned!



Online performances will see a revival in August with three nights of local talent. These performances will be recorded at the Sonic Temple Studio and streamed at 7pm on Halifax Jazz Festival's Facebook and YouTube channel.

To round out August, we’ll be looking at you, our team and our community! The TD Halifax Jazz Festival has been running for 34 years in part to the dedicated festival-family that comes together year after year to make HJF what it is. We’ll be highlighting just some of our wonderful volunteers and team members that make HJF special. We’ll be sharing their stories and giving them a moment to shine.

If you would like to submit your story, please send it along to publicity@halifaxjazzfestival.ca.



We will, of course, miss seeing you on the festival site, but we’d love for you to join us online and flood our social media with memories and highlights of past years.
