Long before DaBaby did a Black Lives Matter remix of "Rockstar" or LL Cool J freestyled about George Floyd or J. Cole devoted his "Crooked Smile" video to 7-year-old Aiyana Stanley-Jones , rappers were telling audiences about lives who mattered.

Since the death of Trayvon Martin in 2012, social justice shout-outs have been commonplace. The ever-socially focused Dead Prez and Yasiin Bey cut "Made You Die," a tribute to Trayvon -- as well as Justin Sipp Kevin Cedeno and others -- weeks after Trayvon was killed. The teen's name has been on rhymesmiths' lips ever since.

Yet even before that, as early as the 1980s, artists such as Public Enemy, NWA and KRS-One and Boogie Down Productions were tapping their influence to put the plights of African Americans in the spotlight.

Here are 10 times some of those rappers called out victims of violence in America.
