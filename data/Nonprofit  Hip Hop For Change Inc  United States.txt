For people concerned with the lack of positive art in our communities, Hip Hop For Change Inc. is the nonprofit that educates all people about the power of Hip Hop Culture and empowers them with a platform to express themselves through the arts.

Right now, we need you more than ever

Two amazing ways to support us right now!

Our most popular shirt ever has been redesigned, now in new styles and colors! In addition to the new Hip Hop For Change logos, we now have new “End White Supremacy” merchandise designed by Adam Dumper available for purchase in the store link below. “End White Supremacy” has been Hip Hop For Change’s signature slogan for the past seven years, and we will continue to stand by that mission for years to come. Thank you to everyone who has been supporting Black businesses and organizations the past couple of weeks! We have received an outpouring of love and support for our merchandise campaign, and for our organization as a whole. Hip Hop For Change is beyond grateful for the support coming from our community.

Please Support Our Emergency Arts-Educator Fund to Re-Employ our Teachers

Unfortunately, due to policies mandating social distancing to prevent the spread of COVID-19, county-wide school closures across the Bay Area have paused our pending contracts for the remaining school year. These programs include after-school classes, assemblies, workshops, and enrichment courses, all geared toward Hip Hop education, artistic youth self-expression, and culturally responsive pedagogy. Thus, the mentor-student relationship between our educators and the youth we serve has been adversely impacted. In addition, over a dozen HH4C artists-educators have been especially impacted due to the performative nature of their trade and mentorship. Many of our educators rely on teaching contracts and artist residencies for their livelihood. Most Hip Hop artists in the Bay Area aren’t eligible for unemployment while still grappling with the severe, if not complete loss of income. ​

Nevertheless, Hip Hop For Change is still working hard amid this crisis, to support local artists as well as our youth. We are beginning a new initiative to provide artists work during the crisis producing online content for youth. Your donations will go directly to paying teaching artists and a local videographer to deliver and edit video content and in creating an online curriculum and portal for community access. Click here to donate and please share this campaign with your networks to ensure we meet our goal and thank you for your continued support.

the three pillars of our work

The Foundation

The mainstream music industry sells sexism, drug abuse, homophobia, materialism, and gang violence as if these problems represent the cornerstones of hip hop culture. The corporate media presents Hip Hop music and culture as a grotesque array of negative stereotypes, embracing criminality, sexism, homophobia, materialism, and domination culture. These corporate representations are part of a historical legacy of oppression of black and brown people; propaganda that demonizes and objectifies people of color is the ideological basis for the legitimization of oppression and prejudice. learn more
