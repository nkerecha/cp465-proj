Ontario has announced 47 new cases of COVID-19, bringing the province’s total case count to 424.

That number includes eight resolved cases and three deaths. More than 8,300 cases remain “under investigation.”

As the number of Canadians infected with COVID-19 climbed to 1,331 yesterday, and the death toll from the illness rose to 19, further actions were being taken to try to slow the spread of the virus and prevent health-care facilities from being overwhelmed.

That includes stricter policing measures to ensure people adhere to self-isolation recommendations that health-care professionals insist are critical in battling COVID-19.

Ontario Provincial Police are warning that people will face fines for violating orders to close certain businesses and to limit gatherings.

"Although voluntary compliance is always preferred, under the Emergency Management and Civil Protection Act, there are consequences for individuals and businesses that choose to defy the Act while it is in force," the OPP said Saturday.
