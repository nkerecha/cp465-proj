With the uncertainty of hosting events this summer, the Lakefield Jazz, Art & Craft Festival Committee has decided to cancel the festival for this year. The event will return in 2021.

This is truly a community event and we thank everyone who has supported the festival over the years. Vendors and sponsors will be contacted by email to make refund arrangements.

We will now look forward to the 2021 event. Please continue to check our website for information on next yearâ€™s festival.

Lakefield Jazz, Art and Craft Festival

A day by the Otonabee River...

The Lakefield Jazz Art Craft Festival invites you, your friends and family to come to a breezy day of outdoor summer living beside Lakefield's scenic Otonabee River, to enjoy a wide variety of Jazz music, colourful works for sale by artisans and crafters, local food and beverage vendors!

Our 2019 Festival was a Great Success!!

Thank you to all of our sponsors and volunteers that helped make the day possible. Thank you to all the people who came out on July 6, 2019 and enjoyed a variety of jazz, artisans and crafters displays, and great food and beverages.

Thank You to our Presenting Corporate Sponsor, The Pyle Group Scotia Wealth Management which allowed us to rent a large shade tent, which was needed on another beautiful summer day. Thank you to Publican House Brewery for providing craft beer, Black's Distillery for the delicious cocktails and to all the sponsors, food vendors, artisans and musicians.
