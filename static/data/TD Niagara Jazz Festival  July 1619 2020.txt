This is an approximation for the home cook—but mostly use your common sense and trust your judgement.

For a 13 x 8 or larger roasting pan with sides at least 3’ high.

Ingredients:

10-12 cups dried bread (2 loaves of day-old Italian bread or baguettes cut into 1-2 inch cubes and left out overnight to dry)

1 ½ cups sugar

1 T cinnamon

1/8 tsp nutmeg

Pinch of salt

6 eggs

2 cups 10% Cream (half and half)

3 cups milk (we use homogenized)

1 tsp vanilla

1 -1 ½ cups raisins

Instructions:

Place dried bread cubes in the baking pan

Mix together sugar, cinnamon, nutmeg, and salt.

In a very large bowl, whisk eggs, cream, milk, and vanilla. Add the sugar mixture to the cream and egg mixture and mix well.

Pour combination over the bread. Add raisins

Toss with your hands to make sure that the bread is evenly soaked and let sit for at least 1 hour or overnight in the fridge.

Bake at 350 for 45 min and drop to 300 for 15 minutes longer until set but not dry. Serve with whiskey sauce—and whipped cream—or ice cream.
